              <h3>Keyboards, time to make the switch</h3>
      <h4>My Knowledge</h4>
      <p>I'll start off by saying I'm not even close to an authority on keyboards, nor
      have I even experienced more than the average person might have. But then again, you
      probably figured that out just by reading the terrible pun in the title. That being
      said, if you're at all interested in hearing about my opinions on some that I do have
      experience with, then you're in the right place. I'll separate this into sections that
      I hope make sense. For the reader: I will be using MK to mean mechanical keyboard.</p>
      <h4>Mechanical</h4>
      <p>I got into the world of MKs just about one year ago. I was, like
      many others, first drawn to clickiness and RGB backlighting. I thought MKs were simply
      meant to be loud and cool. So, I went to Amazon and found the cheapest, best reviewed
      keyboard. For this first year, I have used a
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Redragon-K552-RGB-Mechanical-Keyboard-Construction/dp/B019O9BLVY/ref=psdc_402051011_t1_B016MAK38U">
      Redragon Kumara</a> with Outemo Blue Switches. Throughout this time, I have learned a 
      lot more and hope to share that here.</p>
      <h5>Switches</h5>
      <p>The most famous are Cherry MX switches, I've also used Outemo through my
      own keyboard, and have heard of Gateron. I won't describe and explain all the parts
      of switches and terminology such as actuation points, actuation force, key travel,
      etc. but I recommend you look <a href="https://www.dygma.com/mechanical-switches/the-ultimate-guide-to-mechanical-keyboard-switches-for-2019/">
      here</a> if you do want that in-depth guide. I'll summarize the color switches that I believe
      are most prevalent throughout brands. The reds, a linear, quiet switch. The blues, a
      clicky, loud switch. The browns, a tactile, quiet switch. If you want to feel when the
      key has been pressed without bottoming-out, tactile is for you. If you want to hear
      and feel when the key has been pressed, clicky is, rather obviously, for you. And if
      you want a silent key without feedback on actuation points, linears are for you.</p>
      <h5>Keycaps</h5>
      <p>At first, I wasn't even aware of this world. I thought MKs all came in a box,
      assembled and ready to go. I joined the MK <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/">subreddit</a>
      and was introduced to a whole new way of thinking. Not only is ordering kits and
      assembling them yourself a right of passage, and arguably the more common method
      of purchasing a new keyboard, but there is an entire market of artisanal keycaps,
      particularly for escape keys. </p>
      <h5>Low-Profile?</h5>
      <p>As an avid watcher of both MKBHD and Unbox Therapy, I found myself interested in
      both keyboards created by <a href="https://www.keychron.com/">Keychron</a>. The
      K1, a very low-profile keyboard with almost apple-esque chiclet style keycaps
      piqued my interest as a Mac user. I haven't typed on any keyboards of this style, with
      mechanical switches but smaller key travel, but wonder if they could be the perfect
      joining of laptop-style keyboards and mechanical switches.</p>
      <h4>Apple</h4>
      <p>Apple has had some struggles in the keyboard department recently. I only include this
      because of my particular preference for Macbooks as my laptop of choice. They were doing
      perfectly fine until their decision to innovate the famed "butterfly" switches
      which replaced the normal "scissor" switches. I was fortunate enough to switch directly
      from a 2015 13-inch to a 2019 16-inch, but I did type on the butterfly switches on occasion.
      Considering I never owned them, I never ran into issues long-term with them, but even the
      typing experience was just not as responsive, and it was a lot clicker than most. Here's to
      Apple getting rid of those keyboard forever.</p>
      <h4>Miscellaneous Bullets</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>&#8226; Google's Pixelbook Go has Hush Keys&#8482; that I don't dislike at all for laptops</li>
        <li>&#8226; Apple's Touch Bar isn't the most useful thing in the world but it provides helpful functionality sometimes and is nice to have</li>
        <li>&#8226; Depending on your shortcuts, the efficiency of a keyboard puts a mouse to shame</li>
        <li>&#8226; Don't go for blues, just don't...</li>
