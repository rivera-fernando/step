                  I'm a rising junior at the University of Florida majoring in computer 
                  science with a minor in statistics. As someone interested in technology, 
                  I love learning new skills and utilizing them to create useful projects. 
                  I mainly build full stack web applications and have occasionally dabbled 
                  in Android development. I can usually be found clacking away at my 
                  mechanical keyboard or keeping up with the latest phone and gadget 
                  releases. When I'm not at my desk, I enjoy playing ultimate and tennis, 
                  cooking, and finding more music to add to my playlists.

                      <p>I worked as a teaching assistant for CEN3031 (Introduction to Software
                          Engineering). This class introduces software engineering as a discipline
                          and full-stack web development utilizing the MERN stack. I co-lead two
                          ~30 student discussion periods weekly for the technical side of the course,
                          hosted office hours twice a week, and have given guest lectures to the full
                          class of ~250 on technical demos.</p>

                      <p>I was a teaching assistant for the CSSI-Coursera Programming Foundations

                          had over Slack while organizing community building activities. This
                          position was offered to me after I had completed the same program as one
                          of the top students the previous summer.</p>
