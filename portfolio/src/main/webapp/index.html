                  I'm a rising junior at the University of Florida majoring in computer 
                  science with a minor in statistics. As someone interested in technology, 
                  I love learning new skills and utilizing them to create useful projects. 
                  I mainly build full stack web applications and have occasionally dabbled 
                  in Android development. I can usually be found clacking away at my 
                  mechanical keyboard or keeping up with the latest phone and gadget 
                  releases. When I'm not at my desk, I enjoy playing ultimate and tennis, 
                  cooking, and finding more music to add to my playlists.
